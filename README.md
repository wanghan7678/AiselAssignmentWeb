For the front-end part, I am sorry that I don't have enough time to finish them all.

I have finished the function of token authentication. When a user try to access the web page without a token assigned, it will be automatically redirect to the login page. After login, the user can view the list of the patients.  And the request to the patients backend endpoints, it will automatically add the authorization bear token in the header.

The front end is based on React.

For the front end, to be continued:
1. the add, edit and delete of the patient.
2. incorrect login handling.
3. the css import error to be fixed.  The web page right now is not properly displayed.
